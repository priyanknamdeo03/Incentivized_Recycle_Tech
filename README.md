# Incentivized_Recycle_Tech
Our software Incentivized Recycle Tech. is primarily about recycling the day-to-day household waste and thus following the 3R’s of environmental sustainability for all the human beings benefitting from it. 

# Our software not only targets a specific number of people but our aim is to impact the major societies that can benefit from it. 

The proposed “INVENTORY MANAGEMENT” is economically feasible because  
▪ The system requires very less time factors. 

▪ The system will provide a fast and efficient automated environment instead of a slow and error-prone manual system, thus reducing both time and manpower spent in running the system. 

▪ The system will have a GUI interface and very little user training is required to learn it. 

▪ The system will provide services to view various information for proper managerial decision-making.

▪ Inventory management is required at different locations within a facility or within multiple locations of a supply network to protect the regular and planned course of collection against the random disturbance of running out of space for recyclable goods.
